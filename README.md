# Nanit Camera
## How to install:
- Install Node and npm -> https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm  
- Install https://www.scrypted.app/ and follow instructions on the website.  
- Install Scrypted Plugins using Plugins tab in Scrypted Management Console.
    - FFmpeg Camera Plugin (@scrypted/ffmpeg-camera) 
    - Rebroadcast Plugin (@scrypted/prebuffer-mixin)
- Once you have Scrypted running and can access it...continue  

- Open this plugin directory in VS Code  
- In a terminal cd into this project directory  
- run `npm install` 
- run `npm run build` 
- run `npm run scrypted-deploy 127.0.0.1` 
  - NOTE: you should replace `127.0.0.1` with the ip address of the server you installed Scrypted on if it is not installed locally.
  - The  `Terminal` area may show an authentication failure and prompt you to log in to the Scrypted Management Console with `npx scrypted login 127.0.0.1`, again replacing `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the Scrypted server. You will only need to do this once. You can then run the previous `scrypted-deploy` command again.
  
- Launch Scrypted, go to "Devices"  
- You should see a device named `Nanit Camera Plugin`, click it  
- Enter your email and password on the right, then click save.   
- You'll receive the mfa token enter that in the "Two Factor Code" and click save again  
- Wait a few seconds then reload the page: Refresh Token, Access Token and Expiration should all have values  
- Now go back to devices and you should see a new device that is named the same as your Nanit Device. Click it and then click the video and it should be streaming!  


## Troubleshooting

If you aren't seeing the video load, first try clearing the Expiration value in the `Nanit Camera Plugin` and click save. This will force the plugin to get a new token.  

If you are still having issues then clear the `access_token` and `refresh_token` values and click save. 

Finally, Login again with your username and password + two factor auth by following instructions in above section

## Other Notes
It is currently setup as a Battery camera in Scrypted. The only reason this is done is so that Scrypted doesn't pre-buffer. When the camera is not battery Scrypted will stay connected to the stream 24/7, instead of on demand when the rtsp/homekit stream is requested. I suspect if we stay connected to the Nanit stream 24/7 they would take notice eventually.   

If you want to disable this. Remove the ScryptedInterface.Battery from line main.ts.  
```
const interfaces = [
                ScryptedInterface.Camera,
                ScryptedInterface.VideoCamera,
                ScryptedInterface.MotionSensor,
                ScryptedInterface.Battery //REMOVE THIS
            ];
 ```

 The Snapshot Photos are not working right now. You may see a "Failed Snapshot" screen until I can get that working. 
 

## Importing into Home Assistant
### Method 1
- Under the camera, make sure the rebroadcast plugin is enabled. 
- In the Camera settings go to the Stream and there should be a "RTSP Rebroadcast URL" box. Copy that value
- In HomeAssistant add a camera entity -> https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic/ 
  - The copied value is your "stream source"
